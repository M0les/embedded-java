This project aims to collect a useful toolkit of Java classes intended for embedded use.

General characteristics of this code are:
  * Avoidance of producing garbage wherever possible (Statically allocate or pool/reuse instances that would normally be "throw-away")
  * Implementation of the simplest and most general case of a particular class, without too many "bells and whistles".
